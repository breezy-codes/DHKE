# DHKE
Algorithm to test the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange maths

This program allows the user to input the prime number, primitive root and the two private keys of user A and B.
It then finds the public key of user A and B and the shared secret key.

It can be used to check the mathematical correctness of the DHKE
